ðŸ”´ Red Button â€“ fund
This is a payable function (your fund() in the contract).
When you click it:
It sends Ether from the currently selected Remix account into the contract.
The require inside makes sure the amount is â‰¥ minimumUsd in ETH terms.
The senderâ€™s address gets stored in funders[], and the mapping records how much ETH they sent.

ðŸ‘‰ How to use:
Go to the Value field (just above "Deploy & Run Transactions").
Enter an amount in ETH (e.g., 0.01).
Click fund.
If the ETH sent is enough, the transaction succeeds. Otherwise, youâ€™ll see a revert error.

ðŸŸ  Orange Button â€“ withdraw
This is your withdraw() function.
It will transfer all funds from the contract to the ownerâ€™s account (the one who deployed the contract).
You added onlyOwner (though the modifierâ€™s code isnâ€™t in the screenshot), so only the owner can call it.

ðŸ‘‰ How to use:
Make sure the selected account in Remix is the owner (the deployer).
Click withdraw.
The balance in the contract will drop to 0, and ETH will move to the ownerâ€™s wallet.

ðŸ”µ Blue Buttons â€“ addressToAmountFund, funders, minimumUsd, owner
These represent public state variables in your contract.
Since you marked them as public, Remix automatically generates getter functions.
addressToAmountFund (mapping):
Takes an input (Ethereum address).
Returns how much ETH that address has contributed.
