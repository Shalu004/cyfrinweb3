zkSync is a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, built using zk-Rollups (zero-knowledge rollups).

Breaking It Down:-

Ethereum Layer-1 (Mainnet)
Very secure, but slow and expensive.
Every transaction is processed by all Ethereum nodes.

Layer-2 (zkSync)
Runs on top of Ethereum.
Collects (or "rolls up") many transactions together off-chain.
Uses zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs) to prove that these transactions are valid.
Only the proof (tiny data) is posted back to Ethereum.
This makes it cheaper and faster than doing everything directly on Ethereum.

Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
A cryptographic way to prove something is true without revealing all the details.
zkSync uses it to prove that a batch of transactions is valid, without replaying all of them on Ethereum.
