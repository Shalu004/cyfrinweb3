Foundry is a powerful toolchain for Ethereum development, written in Rust, and used mainly for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

Foundry is made up of several tools:

>Forge = For building, testing, and deploying smart contracts (similar to Hardhat or Truffle).
>Cast = For interacting with Ethereum nodes from the command line â€” sending transactions, reading data, etc.
>Anvil = A fast local Ethereum node for testing (like Ganache or Hardhat Network).
>Chisel = A Solidity REPL (lets you test Solidity expressions interactively).
